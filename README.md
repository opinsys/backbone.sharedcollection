# Backbone.SharedCollection

Created by [Esa-Matti Suuronen](http://esa-matti.suuronen.org/), [Opinsys Oy](http://opinsys.fi/)

Backbone.SharedCollection is a dead simple way to add automatic synchronization
and persistence to your Backbone.js models. You don't need to do any changes to
your Models. All you need to do is add them to a collection created from
`Backbone.SharedCollection` and they will be magically shared between all open
browser instances.

It works by overriding Backbone.sync. The `save` method in models and
collections is not used. All changes are automatically saved and synced as
models change. See usage documentation to see how to ignore this temporally.


This library was orignally created in [Pahvi Project](https://github.com/opinsys/pahvi).


This [commit](https://github.com/opinsys/backbone.sharedcollection/commit/422c54c154d19f8527840334fa868f55cac33ca6)
shows how the stock TODOs example in Backbone.js is changed to use automatic
synchronization using Backbone.SharedCollection instead of just localStorage
persistence.


## Installation

Backbone.SharedCollection uses [Node.js][] and [ShareJS][] to synchronize the
Models. So you need a simple Node.js server. Like this one:


```javascript
var express = require("express");
var sharejs = require("share").server;

var app = express.createServer();

sharejs.attach(app, {
  db:{ type: "none" }
});
```

For persistence options see [ShareJS documentation](https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS).

In addition to Backbone.js you need also ShareJS and it's
dependencies, Socket.io, added to your app:

```html
<!-- Socket.io and ShareJS served directly from Node.js server -->
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script src="/share/share.uncompressed.js"></script>
<script src="/share/json.uncompressed.js"></script>

<!-- Basic Backbone.js dependencies -->
<script src="/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/vendor/underscore.js"></script>
<script src="/vendor/backbone.js"></script>

<!-- and finally you can add Backone.SharedCollection -->
<script src="backbone.sharedcollection.js"></script>
```

For fully working app see
[examples/todos](https://github.com/opinsys/backbone.sharedcollection/tree/master/examples/todos).

## Usage

You start by creating instance of SharedCollection with `collectionId`.
Collection ID is used to connect different collection instances between the
browsers.

```javascript
var collection = new Background.SharedCollection([], {
    collectionId: "mycollection"
});;
```


Connect the collection to ShareJS by calling `fetch` with a ShareJS document.
If you try to add models to the collection before this they will put into a
queue and are really added right after you call the `fetch` method.


```javascript
sharejs.open('todos', 'json', function(err, doc) {
    if (err) throw err;
    collection.fetch({
        sharejsDoc: doc,
        success: initCallback,
        error: displayErrorCallback
    });
});
```
You can use the same ShareJS document for multiple collections.

Then you can just start adding models to your collection

```javascript
function initCallback() {
    model = new Backbone.Model;
    collection.add(model);
}
```

Now all `set`, `destroy` and `collection.add` method calls will be propagated
to all other browser instances automatically.

```javascript
model.set({ foo: "bar" });
model.destroy();
```

If you need to make an only local change to your model you can pass `{ local:
true }` as options to `set`. Remotes won't receive this change.

```javascript
model.set({ foo: "bar local only" }, { local: true });
```

### Custom Models

Custom models in collection works just like Backbone.js documentation
[states](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection-model). Just
override `model` property in the collection with your custom Model class.

```javascript
var Library = Backbone.SharedCollection.extend({
    model: Book
});
```

If you want to have have multiple different Models in single SharedCollection,
then you must do a small modification to your models. Set the type property of
your custom models to some unique string identifier.

```javascript
window.MyModel = Backbone.Model.extend({

    type: "mymodel"

    // Some custom method...
    hasBar: function() {
        !! return this.get("bar");
    }
});

```

and pass those to the shared collection

```javascript
var collection = new Background.SharedCollection([], {
    collectionId: "mycollection",
    modelClasses: [ MyModel ]
});
```

This way SharedCollection can know how to deserialize your custom models.

### Events

#### Updates - `add`, `change` and `destroy`

Remote updates will be emited as normal Backbone.js `change`, `add`, `destroy`
events. If you need to know whether the event came from ShareJS and not by local
code, you can check the options object of the event for `remote` property.

```javascript
model.bind("change", function(model, options) {
    if (options.remote) {
        // Came from remote browser
    }
});

collection.bind("add", function(model, collection, options) {
    if (options.remote) {
        // Came from remote browser
    }
});
```

#### On connected - `connect`

When collection is properly connected to ShareJS a `connect` event will be
emitted. You can also use success callback in `fetch` method for this.

#### Errors - `syncerror`

Synchronization errors will be emited as `syncerror` events in SharedCollection instances.

```javascript
collection.bind("syncerror", function(model, method, err) {
    // `method` is a string, "add", "change" or "destroy", and `err` is the
    // error object from ShareJS
    alert("Failed to " + method + " " + model.id);
});
```


### Authentication

See [User access control](https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS/wiki/User-access-control)
wiki page in ShareJS documention.


## Hacking and debugging

Set `debugSharedCollection` in `localStorage` to true to enable logging.

Install CoffeeScript and UglifyJS to build plain Javascript versions.

    npm install -g coffee-script uglify-js

Use `build` task in Cakefile to build it and `watch` task can be use to
automatically to build it on changes.
